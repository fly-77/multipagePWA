# multipagePWA

An easily extendable progressive webapp template featuring multiple simple example pages , built on a single-page architecture to allow for a common JS context (needed for example when integrating web-Bluetooth) . The app is written with an offline-first user experience in mind, using an offline-first cache-strategy for the service worker.
Once installed app updates are notified to the user via  toasts.
